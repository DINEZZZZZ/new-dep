This can mean you experience constipation or bloating during this phase . To help combat these symptoms, stay well hydrated; eat little and often and chew your food well (10 to 20 chews per mouthful). When it comes to what to eat, don’t overload on fruit or fruit smoothies and reduce salty or processed foods.” Another effect of progesterone is that it can make the body more sensitive to changes in blood sugar, which can lead to food cravings or mood swings. To help keep blood sugar stable, eat regularly (at least every 3 hours) and opt for brown, starchy carbs, lean meats and starchy veg – such as sweet potatoes and squashes – for your meals.',
